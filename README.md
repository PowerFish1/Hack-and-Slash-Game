# Hack-and-Slash-Game
In this particular game project, I have ventured into unexplored territory by incorporating unique and innovative elements that set it apart from other games in the genre. Notably, I have developed a custom damage system and spawn system, showcasing my independent problem-solving capabilities. However, given my relative newness to this domain, there remains the possibility of unidentified issues or areas requiring improvement that I may not have the expertise to address. Nevertheless, this project holds a special place for me, as it demonstrates a harmonious blend of dynamic game sounds and an engaging rhythm, contributing to an immersive and captivating gameplay experience.
